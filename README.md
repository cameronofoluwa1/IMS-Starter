## Prerequisites

To run the project, you will __need__...


* Java 14 or later
* SQL 5.7 or later (& MySQL Workbench)
* Eclipse (Or another Java IDE)

## Testing
In order to run the tests that are currently available in the project, navigate to the project tree and locate the __src/test/java__ folder. Right-click this, navigate to 'Coverage as' --> 'JUnit Test', and allow all the tests to run.

## How to run
To run the programme, open up the project in Eclipse (or another IDE) and locate the runner file from the project main root folder and run this. You'll be greeted with a welcome message and then the option to pick either Customers, Items or Orders to perform CRUD functionality on. Simply type in your choice (not case sensitive) and then you'll have the choice as to what CRUD operation to perform. Depending on your choice, you'll be promted at what input you must provide in order to run the commands successfully.
